##  Prerequisites

---

##  Installation & Setup Guide

### 1. Database Setup

1. Open and login to Clever Cloud MySQL.
2. Create a new database (e.g., `food_beverage_db`).
3. Import the provided SQL dump file (located in `/database/db_schema.sql` or similar path) into the new database.



### 2. Backend Configuration

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd backend

```


2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

```


3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your database configuration (replace this with our .env file that we upload):
```env
PORT=21917
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_NAME=food_beverage_db
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here

```


4. Start the Backend Server:
```bash
npm start

```


*You should see: ` Server running on http://localhost:21917*`

### 3. Frontend Configuration

1. Open a **new** terminal window (keep the backend running).
2. Navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend

```


3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

```


4. Start the Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
# OR (depending on your setup)
npm start

```


5. Open the link provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser.

##  Key Features to Test

1. **Analytics Dashboard:**

* Filter by "Room Service" or "Dine-in" to see dynamic data changes.
* Check "Top Selling Items" (ranked by quantity sold).


2. **Inventory Management:**
* Go to "Inventory Logs".
* Add a new ingredient.
* **Test Feature:** Select "grams" (g) as the unit, and note how the system automatically suggests a high reorder point (1000g).
* Try adjusting stock to see the status change from "Good" to "Low Stock".


3. **Order Management:**
* Create orders for different types (Room Dining vs. Walk-in).
* Verify they appear correctly in the Kitchen View.


# 🚀 Production Deployment Guide
Follow these steps to deploy the application to production using Render.

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub
Open your `terminal` in the project folder and run the following commands to push your code:

1. Initialize a new git repository
```bash
git init

```

2. Stage all files
```bash
git add .

```

3. Commit the files
```bash
git commit -m "Ready for production"

```

4. Link to your GitHub repository
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-github-name/Food-and-Beverages-System.git

```

5. Push to the master branch
```bash
git push -u origin master

```

### Step 2: Create a Render Account
1. Go to Render.com.

2. Sign up using your GitHub account (recommended for easy integration).

### Step 3: Create a New Web Service
1. On the Render Dashboard, click New + and select Web Service.

2. Select the Food-and-Beverages-System repository from the list.

### Step 4: Configure the Service
Fill in the `deployment` details exactly as below to match the `package.json` configuration:

```env
Name: food-and-beverages-system

Region: Select your closest region (e.g., Singapore).

Branch: master

Root Directory: (Leave blank)

Runtime: Node

Build Command: npm run build

Start Command: npm run start

Instance Type: Free

```

### Step 5: Environment Variables
You must manually add your environment variables in the Environment tab on Render. The app will not connect to the `database` without these.

Scroll down to Environment Variables.

Add the following keys (copy values from your local `.env`):
```env
DB_HOST=localhost

DB_USER=root

DB_PASS=your_password_here

DB_NAME=food_beverage_db

PORT=21917(Optional)

```

### Step 6: Deploy
1. Click Create Web Service.

2. Render will start building your app. You can view the progress in the "Logs" tab.

3. Once the logs say `"Your service is live"`, your application is accessible via the provided Render URL.

##  Troubleshooting

* **"Connection Refused" Error:**
* Check if the `.env` file in the backend folder has the correct database password.


* **Charts not loading:**
* Ensure the backend is running on port `21917`.
* If using Chrome, check the Developer Console (F12) > Network tab to ensure requests to `localhost:21917` are succeeding.
