##  Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Recharts (for Analytics)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** Clever Cloud MySQL
* **Tools:** VS Code, Git
* **Deployment:** Render

---

##  Prerequisites

Before running the system, please ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Clever Cloud Server** (Since the system is using centralized database)
---

##  Installation & Setup Guide

### 1. Database Setup

1. Open and login to Clever Cloud MySQL.
2. Create a new database (e.g., `food_beverage_db`).
3. Import the provided SQL dump file (located in `/database/db_schema.sql` or similar path) into the new database.



### 2. Backend Configuration

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd backend

```


2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

```


3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your database configuration (replace this with our .env file that we upload):
```env
PORT=21917
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_NAME=food_beverage_db
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here

```


4. Start the Backend Server:
```bash
npm start

```


*You should see: ` Server running on http://localhost:21917*`

### 3. Frontend Configuration

1. Open a **new** terminal window (keep the backend running).
2. Navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend

```


3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

```


4. Start the Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
# OR (depending on your setup)
npm start

```


5. Open the link provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser.

##  Key Features to Test

1. **Analytics Dashboard:**
* View Sales Trends graphs (uses real-time data).
* Filter by "Room Service" or "Dine-in" to see dynamic data changes.
* Check "Top Selling Items" (ranked by quantity sold).


2. **Inventory Management:**
* Go to "Inventory Logs".
* Add a new ingredient.
* **Test Feature:** Select "grams" (g) as the unit, and note how the system automatically suggests a high reorder point (1000g).
* Try adjusting stock to see the status change from "Good" to "Low Stock".


3. **Order Management:**
* Create orders for different types (Room Dining vs. Walk-in).
* Verify they appear correctly in the Kitchen View.

5. Runtime: Node

6. Build Command: npm run build

7. tart Command: npm run start

8. Instance Type: Free



### Step 5: Environment Variables
You must manually add your environment variables in the Environment tab on Render. The app will not connect to the `database` without these.

Scroll down to Environment Variables.

Add the following keys (copy values from your local `.env`):
```env
# --- Database Configuration (MySQL) ---
DB_HOST= The hostname or IP address (e.g., localhost or Render Host URL)
DB_NAME= The specific name of your database schema
DB_USER= Your MySQL username (e.g., root)
DB_PASSWORD= Your MySQL password
# --- Server Settings ---
PORT= The port the backend runs on (e.g., 5000 or 10000)
DEV_MODE= Set to 'development' or 'production'
JWT_SECRET= A random string used to encrypt user sessions (tokens)
# --- Frontend Connection ---
FRONTEND_URL= The URL where your React app lives (e.g., http://localhost:5173)
VITE_API_URL= The URL where the Backend API lives (e.g., http://localhost:5000)
# --- Payment Gateway (PayMongo) ---
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY= Public key from PayMongo Dashboard (starts with pk_)
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY= Secret key from PayMongo Dashboard (starts with sk_)
PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET= Secret used to verify webhook signatures

```

### Step 6: Deploy
1. Click Create Web Service.

2. Render will start building your app. You can view the progress in the "Logs" tab.

3. Once the logs say `"Your service is live"`, your application is accessible via the provided Render URL.

##  Troubleshooting

* **"Connection Refused" Error:**
* Check if the `.env` file in the backend folder has the correct database password.


* **Charts not loading:**
* Ensure the backend is running on port `21917`.
* If using Chrome, check the Developer Console (F12) > Network tab to ensure requests to `localhost:21917` are succeeding.
